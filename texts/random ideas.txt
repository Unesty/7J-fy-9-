AI algorithms can be used to analyze data and predict next values.

Safety is implemented by understanding the meanings.

Explaination. For human, discrete system is like a maze,
so to understand it must follow all ways. Usually, it
is impossible, so data representation must be used to
explain needed part in a way, that human can recognize.
Human brain, can keep recognizable
attention to up to 5-10 images. Also it can keep less recognizable attention to up to 40-100 images.
1 image is main, it is used to contunue the thought.
So, to explain graph we should highlight 1 node,
less highlight 5 other nodes,
keep in sight no more than 40 nodes.
Then follow connections by sequential highlighting next nodes.
