There are several ways to store data in graph database
if id is saved in position, then it is relative
1) id, data type, lengths, raw bits;
parser will get memory location of each node, then process data types;
connection type is used to store edges
2) id, data type,length, pointer to raw bits;
only difference from 1 is constant node length
3) id, type only;
parser will process each value;
relative because there is no id;
first half of numbers used for values, second to invoke parser procedure according to type;
example: Unicode
4) id, type;
like previous, but id makes node twice bigger, id can be used to insert node without rewriting connections of each other node in static storage
5) id, data type, pointer to raw bits;
you have to create new table for every graph;
parser has to read all data and parse it into memory;
if two graphs overlap, parser has to look at both;
hard to implement;
if you use hash function for id, you cannot do any kind of indexing;
there are some things that are very difficult with this approach
6) id, length, type; best way to store data;
can be indexed, but you need more space than other solutions
7) id, number of in/out nodes, in nodes, out nodes;
type is saved in in nodes and numbers are stored in out nodes;
long int data type connected to raw data type, where raw data is in out section;
in nodes are just numbers;
for fast access, data is stored in main memory;
if data is too big, you can save only part of it and make other parts of the graph dynamic;
don't work well for complex graphs;
not good for searching, because you have to know what is in out nodes;
not good for big graphs;
also bad for indexing;
8) id, out id X times;
simple, fast, easy;
require a lot of memory to connect a node to multiple nodes;
not good for indexing or searching;
not good for large graphs;
no problem for linear graphs
