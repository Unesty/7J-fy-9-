Project will have a graph database and compiler binary executable, that contains header parser.
Header parser should have functionality to compile and run parsers for graphs stored in database.


Visual part

1. Graph Viewer/Editor
1.1 Graph
Nodes and edges can represent other nodes and edges.
It can look like nodes and edges inside nodes and edges.
This representation can be used to visualize
 abstraction.
Each modification will be saved in graph of modifications.

2.4 Tools
2.4.1 Search
Query, for example, is a graph, results may be completely or partially same as it.
2.4.2 Edit
Edit, like, copy, paste, cut, delete, so on.
2.4.2.1 Transform
Position, rotation, scale. Instead of hierarchy there is a graph with different relationship functions.
2.4.2.2 Value 
2.5 Save and Load
Uses file manager. Save inside graph, or as file.
3. General plan
Contains interactive 3d models, that can explain the plan.

Backend

Node has id, number of in/out nodes, in nodes, out nodes; type is saved in in nodes and numbers are stored in out nodes;  long int data type connected to raw data type, where raw data is in out section; in nodes are just numbers;...

Server code has a loop, that listens clients and receives/sends packets. Client has graphical, sound outputs, inputs from keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, other devices. Both server and client use graph db.

UI element has position, collider(plane, rounded plane, cube, rounded cube, sphere, capsule, procedural, 3d model), visual(procedural 3d model, 3d model, or image), state, event.
In the UI editor, the properties of the element are shown as nodes next to it.
They can also be viewed in graph editor in layout, that is more reliable for scripting.

AI algorithms can be used to analyze data and predict next values.
