// Nodes should have alignment, that is easy to understand. There must be not too many, not too few nodes in a view.
// Nodes with different types can be visually different, and can contain values on image.
// Edges can be hidden in some layouts, like text layout. Some types of nodes can look simular to edge to show connection type with values.

// How specific types should look like? What are the best ways to align them?

// Also, tasks can have common alignment.
